# Predicting Quarterback Success in the NFL - Capstone Project 1

## Introduction
The NFL Quarterback is widely considered the most important position in all of professional sports. The first step in building a championship caliber team is finding a franchise quarterback. Finding that quarterback is difficult and the NFL is known for having poor success rates when it comes to drafting prospects. The success rate is basically less than 50%. Therefore, a machine learning model for predicting a prospect's success would be useful during the draft process and on draft day.

## The Goal
The goal of this project was to explore the viability of leveraging open-source machine learning libraries to be able to accurately predict if a college quarterback will have success in the NFL by using basic college passing metrics. This was done by creating a binary classifier that predicts whether or not a quarterback would be above the NFL average for Passer Rating. Passer Rating has a strong relationship to quarterback win percentage.
